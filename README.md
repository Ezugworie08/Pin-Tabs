# Pin-Tabs

## Description
This extension allows the user to pin tabs and keep track of them for short periods.
You can add tabs to your favourites either by clicking on the icon of the extension and then on "add" or through a shortcut (mac: control + option + s, Windows: alt + s, Linux: control + alt + s). 

Pinned tabs expire after a period which you will be able to set (from 1 hour to one week). After the pinned tabs expire, you can get access to them through the chronology of the last six tabs expired
